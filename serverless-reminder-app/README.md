# AWS Serverless Reminder Application

## Overview
This project is based on a hands-on lab from A Cloud Guru. Itâ€™s a serverless reminder application built using AWS services: S3, Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions, SES, and SNS. Completing this lab helped me learn how to design and deploy serverless applications in AWS.

## Project Details
The application allows users to set reminders using a serverless architecture. It includes:
- **AWS S3**: For storage.
- **AWS Lambda**: To handle backend processing.
- **API Gateway**: To expose endpoints for user interaction.
- **Step Functions**: For managing workflows.
- **SES and SNS**: For sending reminders via email and SMS.

## Key Learnings
- **Lambda Functions**: Wrote Lambda functions to handle reminders.
- **API Gateway Integration**: Connected Lambda functions to HTTP endpoints.
- **Step Functions**: Used Step Functions to automate the workflow.
- **Notifications**: Configured SES for email reminders and SNS for SMS.
