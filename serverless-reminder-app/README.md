# AWS Serverless Reminder Application 

## Purpose
The goal was to learn about serverless architecture in AWS, including configuring Lambda functions, managing workflows with Step Functions, and using SNS for notifications.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Lambda Functions**: Gained experience in writing and deploying Lambda functions to handle business logic.
- **Step Functions**: Learned how to orchestrate AWS services with Step Functions for managing reminders.
- **API Gateway**: Used API Gateway to expose endpoints for interacting with the reminder application.
- **SES and SNS**: Configured notifications via SES (email) and SNS (SMS).

## Personal Reflections
One of the challenges I faced was [describe a challenge you encountered]. To solve this, I [describe your solution].

##Cloud Guru Lab Project)

This project is based on a hands-on lab by [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com/). It is a serverless reminder application built using AWS services: S3, Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions, SES, and SNS. Completing this lab allowed me to understand how to architect and deploy a serverless solution in AWS.
